# Rugpulls, hacks, exploits, etc...
## Objective
The goal of this document is to serve as an up-to-date register of every rugpull, hack, exploit, etc... taking place on Ethereum & its sidechains to help users make more informed decisions when eyeing up prospective investments. Not all entries will necessarily be DeFi projects, and I'd like to focus on *services* rather than arbitrary tokens created purely for pumping & dumping. **Whale Farm**, for example, seems like an obvious scam token, but they did also provide yield farming opportunities. With this initial release I've only included events from 2021 and onward, but in the future I plan to add older events too.

I intend to update this document on a weekly basis at minimum, but I'll usually check up on these events daily. 

If you have any questions for me or know of any (new or old) entries that you think I may have missed, please reach out with the contact information below, or submit a pull request.

##### Sidenote - I recommend watching RugDoc.io's [website](https://rugdoc.io) and following them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RugDocIO), as they do a great job reviewing projects for rug-potential.

For an up-to-date list of all slashings & rugpulls related to staking pools, see this link: [https://github.com/TheSquanch-147/Staking-Pool-Mishaps](https://github.com/TheSquanch-147/Staking-Pool-Mishaps)

## In the pipeline
- Add events occurring pre-2021
- Additional chart detailing audit protocol(s) of the top 25-50 DeFi projects.
- Include a metric showing how long a project has been live without exploitation.
