# Rugpulls, hacks, exploits, etc...

## Objective

The goal of this document is to serve as an up-to-date register of every rugpull, hack, exploit, etc... taking place on Ethereum & its sidechains to help users make more informed decisions when eyeing up prospective investments. Not all entries will necessarily be DeFi projects, and I'd like to focus on *services* rather than arbitrary tokens created purely for pumping & dumping. With this initial release I've only included events from 2021 and onward, but in the future I plan to add older events too.

If you have any questions for me or know of any (new or old) entries that you think I may have missed, please reach out with the contact information below, or submit a pull request.

##### Sidenote - I recommend watching RugDoc.io's [website](https://rugdoc.io) and following them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RugDocIO), as they do a great job reviewing projects for rug-potential. Huge shoutout to [Rekt](https://rekt.news), and [Watchpug](https://watchpug.medium.com) as they've become my go-to for their investigations into these events.

For an up-to-date list of all slashings & rugpulls related to staking pools, see this link: <https://github.com/TheSquanch-147/Staking-Pool-Mishaps>

## In the pipeline

-   Add events occurring pre-2021
-   Additional chart detailing audit protocol(s) of the top 25-50 DeFi projects.
-   Include a metric showing how long a project has been live without exploitation.

| Tomb Finance                      | Fantom Opera   | Exploit  | $TOMB stablecoin pegged to value of $FTM by way of a "gate keeper" fee system. The Gatekeeper collects fees on $TOMB sales until it reaches its peg with $FTM (up to 20%). Fees collected are then sold by the DAO for $FTM, with the other half provided as liquidity if it's above the peg, or burned if below the peg.<br><br>User found a way to avoid this tax (exploit?), and made it publicly available via a website. Tomb team shut down their gatekeeper as a result, causing the stablecoin to lose its peg and the protocol's token price to tank. | 09/03/2021 | [\[Link\]](https://twitter.com/tombfinance/status/1433663013492600844)                                                                | [\[Link\]](https://twitter.com/tombfinance/status/1433663013492600844)                                                                                           |
| Cream Finance                     | ETH            | Exploit  | 17 transactions were issued that utilized an exploit which would allow the attackers (Primary + Copycat) to nest a secondary borrow function inside of the token transfer function before the initial borrow function was updated. This allowed the loan to be paid back while keeping the remainder from the secondary borrow function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 08/31/2021 | [\[Link\]](https://medium.com/cream-finance/c-r-e-a-m-finance-post-mortem-amp-exploit-6ceb20a630c5)                                   | [\[Link\]](https://medium.com/cream-finance/c-r-e-a-m-finance-post-mortem-amp-exploit-6ceb20a630c5)                                                              |
| X-Token                           | BSC            | Exploit  | An attacker was able to call a function (that should not be publicly available) due to a vulnerability in X-Token's xSNX code. This has already happened once in the past (May, 2021) and failed to be patched. Devs are planning to compensate their users and shut down their xSNX contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 08/29/2021 | [\[Link\]](https://medium.com/xtoken/xsnx-post-mortem-666d35071f38)                                                                   | [\[Link\]](https://medium.com/xtoken/xsnx-post-mortem-666d35071f38)                                                                                              |
| Punk Protocol                     | ETH            | Exploit  | Attacker exploited a "crucial flaw in the  investing strategy". A whitehat hacker noticed these transactions with his/her frontrunning bot and managed to recover ~$6m (at time of writing). The whitehat negotiated with Punk & agreed to return ~$5m, taking $1m as their bounty. The hacker was able to keep ~$3m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 08/10/2021 | [\[Link\]](https://medium.com/punkprotocol/punk-finance-fair-launch-incident-report-984d9e340eb)                                      | [\[Link\]](https://medium.com/punkprotocol/punk-finance-fair-launch-incident-report-984d9e340eb)                                                                 |
| Poly Network                      | Poly, ETH, BSC | Exploit  | Poly had a vulnerability that allowed the attacker to call special contracts by replicating the signature hash (through a bit of trial and error) which would allow them to change the public keys. Read the Rekt writeup (link to the right) for more details. Roughly $611m stolen at time of writing. The attacker has begun returning some of the funds and claims that he will return the rest.                                                                                                                                                           | 08/10/2021 | [\[Link\]](https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/)                                                                                       | [\[Link\]](https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/)                                                                                                                  |

| Popsicle Finance                  | ETH            | Exploit  | Attacker modified the information fed to the contract to convince it that their funds were depostied for longer than they really were, entitling them to a greater share of the fees generated. This allowed them to drain 85% of one of Popsicle Finance's UniswapV3 Optimizer pools, worth roughly $20.7m at the time of the attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 08/03/2021 | [\[Link\]](https://popsiclefinance.medium.com/popsicle-finance-post-mortem-after-fragola-hack-f45b302362e0)                           | [\[Link\]](https://popsiclefinance.medium.com/popsicle-recovery-plan-update-523915087622)                                                                        |
